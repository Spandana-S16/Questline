## 📂 The Vault (Folder Structure)

All sacred artifacts reside within `_Project`. Disorganizing the vault will result in a loss of XP:

```text
Assets/
└── _Project/
    ├── 📜 Scripts/    (Logic: Player, NPCs, Quests, UI)
    ├── 📦 Prefabs/    (Blueprints: World Objects, Quest Items)
    ├── 🖼️ Scenes/     (The Stages: Levels and World Maps)
    ├── 🎨 Art/        (Visuals: Textures and Models)
    ├── 🔊 Audio/      (Ambience: Music and SFX)
    ├── 🍱 UI/         (Interfaces: Icons, Fonts, Layouts)
    └── ⚙️ Settings/   (The Laws: Physics and Input)

```

> ⚠️ **The Guild Code:**
> * All custom creations **MUST** be stored inside `Assets/_Project/`.
> * Do **NOT** disturb the ancient ruins (files outside `_Project`).
> * Foreign artifacts (Third-party assets) stay in their own camps.
